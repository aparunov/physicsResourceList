Repository of Useful Books in Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science
This repository contains a selection of books, primarily problem collections, in the fields of physics, mathematics, and computer science.

While this list is not exhaustive, the goal is to provide a minimal set of problems that will enhance the reader's problem-solving skills, both quantitatively and qualitatively. There are, of course, many other excellent books, but this list should suffice to elevate the reader to a high level of problem-solving proficiency.

### Physics
## Problems in General Physics by I.E. Irodov
This book offers a large number of (partially) solved problems in general physics, covering topics such as kinematics, dynamics, electromagnetism, electric circuits, and thermodynamics.

Mathematical prerequisites include mastery of algebra and trigonometry, along with a working knowledge of calculus and vectors.

## Science For Everyone: Aptitude Test Problems In Physics by S.S. Krotov
Similar to Irodov, this book is arguably mathematically easier but conceptually more challenging. It is a staple for students preparing for the International Physics Olympiad.

## Exploring Classical Mechanics: A Collection of 350+ Solved Problems for Students, Lecturers, and Researchers by G.L. Kotin and V.G. Serbo
This book covers problems in classical mechanics, with topics including Lagrangian mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics, oscillations, and motion in a central potential.
Mathematical prerequisites include calculus, differential equations, calculus of variations, vector calculus, and linear algebra.

## Problems in Electrodynamics by V.V. Batygin and I.N. Toptygin
A collection of problems in electrodynamics, this book is challenging, and the solutions are quite concise. Proceed with caution.
Prerequisites include expertise in vector and tensor calculus, as well as special functions.

## Exploring Quantum Mechanics: A Collection of 700+ Solved Problems for Students, Lecturers, and Researchers by V. Galitski, B. Karnakov, V. Kogan, and V. Galitski Jr.
Quantum mechanics is a notoriously difficult subject for two reasons. Firstly, it requires students to abandon classical intuitions about the world. For example, in quantum mechanics, the trajectory of a body doesn't make sense, and it postulates that at best we can know the probability distributions of physical quantities, rather than precise values. Secondly, due to the aforementioned conceptual difficulties, a more advanced mathematical apparatus was developed. This new apparatus involves the notion of Hilbert space, with the theory built using linear operators on this space. Further, advanced calculus is required, as well as mastery in classical mechanics and electromagnetism, to fully grasp the intricacies of the theory.
This book is essential for anyone interested in understanding or conducting physics research. With over 700 solved problems, it helps readers become competent with the advanced mathematical apparatus and connect theory with experimental results.

## Statistical Mechanics: An Advanced Course with Problems and Solutions by R. Kubo
Statistical physics can be viewed in two ways. On one hand, it might be considered the least fundamental branch of physics, as it doesn't explain anything fundamental about the universe. On the other hand, it could be seen as the most fundamental, as it predicts the behavior of systems irrespective of the microscopic theory.

Statistical mechanics is arguably the most challenging subject in physics for undergraduate students. It requires advanced knowledge of classical mechanics, electrodynamics, and quantum physics, along with a comfort in combinatorics and asymptotics.

R. Kubo, a master of the subject, provides a collection of problems covering most of the topic.
