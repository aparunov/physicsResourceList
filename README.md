# Repository of Useful Books in Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science

Welcome to this repository, where you'll find a carefully selected range of books, predominantly collections of problems, in physics, mathematics, and computer science.

Problem-solving stands at the core of scientific and engineering expertise, serving as a testament to one's understanding of a subject. In choosing problem-solving materials, one must balance the risk of over-specialization against the breadth of knowledge. Focusing narrowly on a single area, like math Olympiad problems, can lead to overfitting — knowing all the tricks but struggling with novel problems. Conversely, spreading oneself too thin across multiple disciplines can lead to vast but shallow knowledge, hindering deep problem-solving skills. Therefore, a balanced mix of brainteasers, mathematics, computer science, and physics is ideal. This combination provides the necessary depth and breadth, as both physics and computer science are deeply rooted in mathematical principles and closely tied to the physical world. Mathematics enriches this blend with its inherent problem-based nature, while brainteasers and logical puzzles sharpen out-of-the-box thinking, creating a well-rounded problem solver.

Though not exhaustive, this list aims to provide a foundational set of problems to significantly enhance the reader's problem-solving abilities, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Different styles of problem-solving are represented in these books. Some adopt the "American style" — a fewer number of problems explored in great depth — while others follow the "Russian style," featuring a large array of challenging problems with succinct solutions. Both approaches have their merits: American style books hone the art of problem-solving, and once proficiency is achieved, Russian style books offer an excellent platform to test one's knowledge.

## General

The general category includes brainteasers, short math, and physics problems. These books typically require less advanced math but are nonetheless challenging, focusing on developing critical thinking rather than mere calculation.

### Professor Povey's Perplexing Problems: Pre-University Physics and Maths Puzzles with Solutions by T. Povey

This book demonstrates that advanced math isn't a prerequisite for challenging problems; the difficulty lies in conceptual understanding.

### A Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance interviews by Xinfeng Zhou

Quantitative finance interviews often feature brainteasers and challenging math problems, including combinatorics, probability, recursion, dynamic programming, and advanced topics like calculus. This book provides a comprehensive collection of such questions.

## Physics

### Problems in General Physics by I.E. Irodov

Covering a wide range of topics in general physics, this book offers numerous (partially) solved problems in areas like kinematics, dynamics, electromagnetism, electric circuits, and thermodynamics. Prerequisites include a strong foundation in algebra, trigonometry, and a working knowledge of calculus and vectors.

### Science For Everyone: Aptitude Test Problems In Physics by S.S. Krotov

Similar to Irodov's work but arguably easier mathematically and more challenging conceptually. It's particularly beneficial for those preparing for the International Physics Olympiad.

### Exploring Classical Mechanics: A Collection of 350+ Solved Problems by G.L. Kotin and V.G. Serbo

This compilation delves into classical mechanics, covering Lagrangian mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics, oscillations, and motion in central potentials. It requires knowledge of calculus, differential equations, the calculus of variations, vector calculus, and linear algebra.

### Problems in Electrodynamics by V.V. Batygin and I.N. Toptygin

A challenging collection in electrodynamics, where the solutions are concise and require a deep understanding. Prerequisites include expertise in vector and tensor calculus, as well as special functions.

### Exploring Quantum Mechanics: A Collection of 700+ Solved Problems by V. Galitski et al.

This comprehensive guide to quantum mechanics challenges the reader to abandon classical intuitions. It necessitates advanced calculus, as well as a solid grounding in classical mechanics and electromagnetism, to navigate the complexities of Hilbert space and linear operators.

### Statistical Mechanics: An Advanced Course with Problems and Solutions by R. Kubo

Statistical mechanics, a challenging field for undergraduates, bridges physics and information theory. It requires knowledge of classical mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum physics, combinatorics, and asymptotics. R. Kubo's collection comprehensively covers this topic.

This concludes the physics section, with a note that more advanced topics like general relativity and quantum field theory, while not included here, are specialist areas requiring a deeper expertise.

## Mathematics

The mathematics section will follow, starting with a collection of dice problems:

This is a nice set of problems covering most elementary concepts in probability, statistics and counting. 
Mathematical aparatus ranges from elementary algebra all the way to Markov chains so it is suitable for all levels.

### Problem-Solving Strategies by A. Engel

Compilation of 1300 solved problems from mathematical olympiads with problem solving strategies. 

### A Collection of Problems on Complex Analysis (Dover Books on Mathematics) Revised ed. Edition by L. I. Volkovyskii, G. L. Lunts, I. G. Aramanovich 

Russian-style book with problems in complex analysis. 

## Computer Science:

Comupter science problem solving is synonimous with programming.
Learning how to code and solve these problems will hone ones abilities to think algorithmically as well as imporove one's mathematical knowledge, especially in areas of discrete mathematics. 

Thankfully there is plethora of online resources for programming. The best one is still: http://usaco.org/index.php
There are number of problems, ranging from simple algorithms all the way to dynanic programming and advanced data structures.
